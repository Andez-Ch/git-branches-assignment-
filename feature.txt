INTRODUCTION
Johnan Vehicles was ventured in by Mr. Kangumenawe Johnan 
in early 2014 and what motivated him was the time he lacked
 means of transport to move to his destination, he realized
  the shortage of vehicles to do the services. Then he decided
to use his savings to secure two cars and two motorcycles which
 he gave to different drivers and ridders respectively as his 
 employees. As years moved on, he managed to expand and now owns
  number of cars, vans, motorcycles and trucks.  The business is 
  located in Lusaka Village, Kiganda Parish, East Division,
   Hoima City opposite Total Petro station.
He manages the collection of money from the customers of Johnan 
Vehicles daily, he records customers’ details and repair expenses
 manually. This gives challenges in record keeping and other
  associated errors. Bookings or requests of hiring the vehicles
 are done on phone calls and physically on ground which make 
confusion in fulfilling accurate requests due to many vehicles.
    For instance, one vehicle is booked and promised to more than
     one customer which has slowed the trust of his customers and
      it’s not intended sometimes customers calls his manager and
 others contact him hence failing the coordination.
